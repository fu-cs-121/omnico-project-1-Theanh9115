## Introduction

Project's objective is to find which algorithm produces the highest happiness ratings and which one keeps users engaged for the longest time.

## Methodology

I store the file data into dictionary and use for loop to calculate the result.

## Results

- **Average Happiness Rating per Algorithm**

  - JoyStream: 8.50
  - SerenityFlow: 7.00
  - DeepPulse: 5.00

- **Total Number of Sessions per Algorithm**

  - JoyStream: 4
  - SerenityFlow: 3
  - DeepPulse: 3

- **Average Session Duration per Algorithm**

  - JoyStream: 37.50 minutes
  - SerenityFlow: 30.00 minutes
  - DeepPulse: 45.00 minutes

- **Highest and Lowest Performers**
  - Highest Average Happiness Rating: 8.50
  - Longest Average Session Duration: 45.00 minutes

## Observations and Insights

  - It seems that the longest the duration of algorithm has the lowest average happiness. However, the shortest duration does not mean highest rating.
  - DeepPulse may make users engage too much with emotional content that users become bored.
  - SerenityFlow maybe a great experience, but too short.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

--- JoyStream is a decent algorithm so far. Need to test different algorithms duration to be sure which one is appopriate.
